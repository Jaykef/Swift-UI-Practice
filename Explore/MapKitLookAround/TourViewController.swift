             When the map is pitched, route polylines created through `MKDirections.Request` follow the elevation of the
             terrain, such as hills, overpasses, and bridges. Further, these polylines blend with the surrounding landscape,
             so they are visible through buildings, trees, and in tunnels. Take note of these examples:
             
             1. When navigating from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Palace of Fine Arts, the route goes through multiple
             tunnels. If you zoom in on these sections of the route, the section of the polyline in the tunnels is blended with
             the surrounding terrain.
             
             2. When zooming in to Coit Tower, the elevation of Telegraph Hill becomes visible, and the route polyline follows
             the road elevation as it ascends Telegraph Hill to Coit Tower. The route polyline to Sutro Tower also demonstrates this.
