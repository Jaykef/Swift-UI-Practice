# Explore a location with a highly detailed map and Look Around

Display a richly detailed map, and use Look Around to experience an interactive view of landmarks.

## Overview

This sample code project takes the user on a tour of landmarks in San Francisco, using MapKit to do the following:
* Show a highly detailed map, including trees, realistic elevation, and detailed building renderings for landmark locations
* Navigate between landmarks, with the navigation route following the elevation of the roads and blending with landscape features
* Animate the map between landmarks
* Display the landmark using an interactive `MKLookAroundViewController`, as well as a snapshot of the landmark with `MKLookAroundSnapshotter`
